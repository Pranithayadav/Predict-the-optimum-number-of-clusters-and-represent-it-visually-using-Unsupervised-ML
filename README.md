Choose the number of clusters k The first step in k-means is to pick the number of clusters, k.

Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids Next, we randomly select the centroid for each cluster. Letâ€™s say we want to have 2 clusters, so k is equal to 2 here. We then randomly select the centroid.

Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid Once we have initialized the centroids, we assign each point to the closest cluster centroid.

Step 4: Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters Now, once we have assigned all of the points to either cluster, the next step is to compute the centroids of newly formed clusters.

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4.
